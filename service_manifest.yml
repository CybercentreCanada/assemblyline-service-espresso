description: This Assemblyline service analyzes Java JAR files. All classes are extracted, decompiled and analyzed for malicious behavior.

# Regex defining the types of files the service accepts and rejects
accepts: java/jar
rejects: empty|metadata/.*

# At which stage the service should run (one of FILTER, EXTRACT, CORE, SECONDARY, POST, REVIEW)
# NOTE: Stages are executed in the order defined in the list
stage: CORE
# Which category the service is part of (one of Antivirus, Dynamic Analysis, External, Extraction, Filtering, Internet Connected, Networking, Static Analysis)
category: Static Analysis

# Does the service require access to the file to perform its task
# If set to false, the service will only have access to the file metadata (e.g. Hashes, size, type, ...)
file_required: true
